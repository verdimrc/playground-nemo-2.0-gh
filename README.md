# Playground: dev/test Nemo-2.0

**Disclaimer**: Please treat this repo as if it was written by Some Guy On The Internet. Opinions
expressed are solely my own.

This repo chronicles the early adoption experience to Nemo-2.0. It provides a bunch of useful
scripts and journals to get Nemo-2.0 works, also some "hidden" tricks (alhtough most, if not all,
should be now reflected in the latest Nemo-2.0 documentation).

Materials are organized by `xx-activity` folders.

> **Please assume you always need to review (and even edit) the files before you run anything.**

Happy coding & experimenting!
