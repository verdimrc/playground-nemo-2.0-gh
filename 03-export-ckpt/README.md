# Convert Nemo-2.0 checkpoint to HF checkpoint

Atm very simple, just view the example in `scratch.sh`. Note that this `.sh` script is meant for
viewing only, and not for execution. I just used `.sh` to get syntax highlighting.

This example requires you to first create a Nemo-2.0 checkpoint of a tiny llama3 model using
[01-cpt-toy-llama3/01-pretrain.sh](../01-cpt-toy-llama3/01-pretrain.sh). Then, you can follow the
steps in [scratch.sh](scratch.sh).
